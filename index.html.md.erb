title: CredHub Service Broker for PCF
owner: CredHub
---

The CredHub Service Broker for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) allows apps running on Pivotal Application Service (PAS) to access credentials in CredHub for services
that are not on PAS. 
The service uses secure service instance credentials 
to prevent credential exposure in the app environment and the Cloud Foundry API.

## <a id='overview'></a>Overview

The CredHub Service Broker for PCF registers a service broker with PCF and exposes its service plans on the
Marketplace. Developers can then create service instances using Apps Manager or the Cloud Foundry Command
Line Interface (cf CLI) and bind them to their apps.

Creating a Credhub Service Broker instance and binding it to an app creates a credential in CredHub and provides the reference
to that credential in the app environment. 
This allows developers to deploy apps that can securely access
credentials for services that are not running on PAS.

## <a id='features'></a>Key Features

CredHub Service Broker for PCF includes the following key features:

* Secure access to service credentials for services that are not running on PAS
