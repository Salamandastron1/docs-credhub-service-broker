**This topic begins with a brief description of what the product tile (e.g. Apigee Edge Service Broker for PCF) does, 
whereas the Overview section below describes what the service itself (e.g. Apigee Edge) does. See below for an example.**

The CredHub Service Broker allows apps on the platform to access credentials in CredHub for services
that are not on the platform. The CredHub Service Broker leverages the secure service instance credentials workflow
to prevent credential exposure in the app environment and the CF API.

**Note**: This description will appear under **OVERVIEW** in the tile's listing on 
[Pivotal Network](http://network.pivotal.io).

**The overview describes the service that your product offers to PCF developers. 
Make sure to overview the features of the integration.
Don't focus only on the overview of your product that is being integrated.
See below for an example.**

The CredHub Service Broker for PCF registers a service broker with PCF and exposes its service plans on the
Marketplace. Developers can then create service instances using Apps Manager or the Cloud Foundry Command
Line Interface (cf CLI) and bind them to their apps.

Creating a Credhub Service Broker instance and binding it to an app creates a credential in CredHub and provides the reference
to that credential in the app's environment. This allows developers to deploy apps which will be able to securely access
credentials for services that are not running on the platform.

**Note**: This overview will appear under **OVERVIEW**, combined with the description above in the tile's listing on
