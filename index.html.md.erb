<p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING</strong>: CredHub Service Broker for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) is currently in beta and is intended for evaluation and test purposes only. Do not use this product in a PCF production environment.</p>

The CredHub Service Broker for PCF allows apps running on Pivotal Application Service (PAS) to access secure credentials in CredHub. 

Apps can use these credentials to authenticate with services not on PAS. These may include services running within PCF such as Spring Cloud Services for PCF or services external to PCF.

The CredHub Service Broker for PCF uses secure service instance credentials
to prevent credential exposure in the app environment.

## <a id='overview'></a>Overview

The CredHub Service Broker for PCF registers a service broker with PCF and exposes its service plans on the
Marketplace. Developers can then create service instances using Apps Manager or the Cloud Foundry Command
Line Interface (cf CLI) and bind them to their apps.

Creating a Credhub Service Broker instance and binding it to an app creates a credential in CredHub and provides the reference
to that credential in the app environment. 
This allows developers to deploy apps that can securely access
credentials for services that are not running on PAS.

## <a id='features'></a>Key Features

CredHub Service Broker for PCF includes the following key features:

* Secure access to service credentials for services that are not running on PAS
